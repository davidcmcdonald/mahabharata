    title: "Origins of the Kuru Heirs",
    summary: `King Vicitravīrya of the Kuru dynasty dies without children, leaving the royal line in crisis. His elder half-brother Bhīṣma (son of King Śāntanu and the river goddess Gaṅgā) cannot take the throne, because he once swore a vow before gods, sages, and citizens of lifelong celibacy to secure his father’s marriage. Their mother, Queen Satyavatī, turns to her firstborn son from an earlier union, the sage Vyāsa, to continue the dynasty through niyoga (an ancient custom where a man fathers children on behalf of a deceased husband). Vyāsa fathers three heirs: Dhṛtarāṣṭra was conceived when Queen Ambikā, during her union with Vyāsa, shut her eyes in fear; her son was therefore born blind. Pāṇḍu was conceived when Queen Ambālikā, during her union with Vyāsa, turned pale with terror; her son was therefore born with pale skin. Vidura was conceived when a maidservant, during her union with Vyāsa, greeted him calmly and respectfully; her son was therefore born wise and virtuous. Under Bhīṣma’s regency and guidance, the three boys grow up. When grown, Dhṛtarāṣṭra marries Gāndhārī of Gandhāra, who blindfolds herself out of loyalty to her blind husband. Pāṇḍu wins Kuntī at her marriage contest (svayaṃvara) and later marries Mādrī, princess of Madra, through negotiations with her brother Śalya. With these marriages, the Kuru dynasty seems secure once more.`,
