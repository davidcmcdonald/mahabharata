    "title": "Dynastic Crisis and Niyoga",
    "summary": "King Vicitravīrya of the Kuru dynasty dies without children, leaving the royal line in crisis. His elder half-brother Bhīṣma (son of King Śāntanu and the river goddess Gaṅgā) cannot take the throne, because he once swore a vow before gods, sages, and citizens of lifelong celibacy to secure his father’s marriage. Their mother, Queen Satyavatī, turns to her firstborn son from an earlier union, the sage Vyāsa, to continue the dynasty through niyoga (an ancient custom where a man fathers children on behalf of a deceased husband). Vyāsa fathers three heirs: Dhṛtarāṣṭra was conceived when Queen Ambikā, during her union with Vyāsa, shut her eyes in fear; her son was therefore born blind. Pāṇḍu was conceived when Queen Ambālikā, during her union with Vyāsa, turned pale with terror; her son was therefore born with pale skin. Vidura was conceived when a maidservant, during her union with Vyāsa, greeted him calmly and respectfully; her son was therefore born wise and virtuous. Under Bhīṣma’s regency and guidance, the three boys grow up. When grown, Dhṛtarāṣṭra marries Gāndhārī of Gandhāra, who blindfolds herself out of loyalty to her blind husband. Pāṇḍu wins Kuntī at her marriage contest (svayaṃvara) and later marries Mādrī, princess of Madra, through negotiations with her brother Śalya. With these marriages, the Kuru dynasty seems secure once more.",

    "summary": "King Pāṇḍu, disinterested in luxury, turns to restoring the Kuru dynasty’s authority. With Bhīṣma’s blessing he wages a year-long campaign across the world, defeating kings and amassing wealth before returning triumphantly to Hastināpura. Though he shares the riches with his brothers, Pāṇḍu prefers the solitude of the Himālayas, where he retires with Kuntī and Mādrī.\nDuring a hunt, Pāṇḍu mistakenly kills the sage Kindama disguised as a mating deer. Cursed to die the next time he approaches a wife in passion, he renounces pleasure and embraces ascetic life with his queens, who refuse to leave him. In the forest at Saptasrota, he laments his inability to father children. Kuntī reveals her secret boon from Durvāsā, enabling her to summon gods to beget children. Through the mantra, she bears three sons: Yudhiṣṭhira (from Dharma), Bhīma (from Vāyu), and Arjuna (from Indra). Mādrī, given the mantra once, invokes the twin Aśvins and bears Nakula and Sahadeva. Thus the five Pāṇḍavas are born and raised among sages, growing rapidly in strength, beauty, and wisdom.",

    "summary": "In Hastināpura, Dhṛtarāṣṭra rules as monarch with Bhīṣma’s support, performing grand sacrifices and bringing prosperity to the kingdom. When the sage Vyāsa visits, Gāndhārī serves him faithfully and receives his blessing: she will bear one hundred sons. But her pregnancy lingers for two years. In frustration, she strikes her womb and delivers only a lump of flesh. Vyāsa intervenes, dividing it into 101 pieces placed in pots of ghee. After two years, the pots produce one hundred sons and one daughter, Duḥśalā. The firstborn, Duryodhana, is accompanied by dreadful omens. Vidura warns Dhṛtarāṣṭra to abandon the child for the safety of the dynasty, but the king refuses.\nMeanwhile in the Himalayas, tragedy befalls Pāṇḍu. Overcome by passion, he forgets the curse of Kindama and embraces Mādrī. The curse strikes, and he dies in her arms. Stricken with grief, Mādrī insists on joining him on the funeral pyre, entrusting her sons to Kuntī’s care. With the aid of sages, Kuntī returns to Hastināpura with her five sons, the Pāṇḍavas. The sages reveal the divine parentage of the brothers before vanishing, leaving the Kurus to mourn Pāṇḍu and welcome his heirs.\nIn the aftermath, Vyāsa warns his mother Satyavatī of the coming age of Kali, a dark time that will destroy the Kuru line. She withdraws into the forest with Ambālikā, leaving Ambikā in the city.",

    "summary": "In Hastināpura, the Pāṇḍavas grow up alongside the Kauravas. Bhīma’s strength and playful dominance humiliate the Kauravas, especially Duryodhana, whose jealousy festers. With his brother Duḥśāsana and his scheming uncle Śakuni, Duryodhana plots to kill Bhīma by feeding him poisoned food and throwing him into the Gaṅgā. Bhīma, however, is saved by the Nāgas, who not only neutralize the poison but also grant him celestial nectar (rasa), giving him the strength of ten thousand elephants.\nWhen Bhīma returns unharmed, the Pāṇḍavas keep silent on Duryodhana’s attempt, though they become vigilant. Yuyutsu, a half-brother of the Kauravas born of a maid, secretly warns the Pāṇḍavas of more plots, but Bhīma is now invulnerable.\nThe princes continue their training under the brahmin warrior Kṛpa, until one day a mysterious brāhmaṇa (Droṇa) demonstrates miraculous martial skill and is recognized by Bhīṣma as the ideal teacher. Droṇa is appointed guru to both Kauravas and Pāṇḍavas. Arjuna excels under his guidance and becomes his favored disciple, earning mastery of all weapons.\nMeanwhile, Ekalavya, a Niṣāda tribal prince, rejects Droṇa’s refusal to teach him and instead fashions a clay image of him, practicing archery in devotion before it. His skills grow astonishing, even surpassing Arjuna’s. When Droṇa and Arjuna confront him, Ekalavya offers guru-dakṣiṇā and, at Droṇa’s request, cuts off his right thumb, crippling his archery but upholding the guru-disciple principle.",

    "summary": "The princes reach mastery under Droṇa’s tutelage, each excelling in a different weapon, with Arjuna surpassing all. Droṇa tests their focus with the wooden bird trial, and only Arjuna succeeds. Later, Arjuna rescues Droṇa from a crocodile attack, earning the gift of the brahmāstra. Declaring the princes’ education complete, Droṇa organizes a grand public exhibition of their martial skills.\nIn the arena, the Pāṇḍavas and Kauravas dazzle the crowd with displays of archery, swordplay, mace fighting, and celestial weapons. Arjuna shines brightest, winning the adoration of the citizens. But the exhibition is interrupted by the sudden arrival of Karṇa, who matches Arjuna’s feats and demands a duel.\nTension fills the arena as Kṛpa questions Karṇa’s lineage, since duels were only permitted among equals. Exposed as the foster son of a charioteer, Karṇa is crowned king of Aṅga by Duryodhana on the spot, cementing their friendship. Bhīma mocks Karṇa’s birth, while Duryodhana defends him as a hero regardless of origin.\nWatching silently, Kuntī faints. Within her heart she hides her terrible secret: Karṇa is her firstborn son, conceived before marriage when she tested the mantra from Durvāsā with the sun god Sūrya. Ashamed and fearful, she abandoned him as an infant. Now she watches him stand as Arjuna’s equal, unable to reveal the truth.",

The Kauravas attack first but are routed; then the Pāṇḍavas strike, with Arjuna defeating Drupada in single combat and bringing him captive to Droṇa. Droṇa spares his former friend but divides Pañchāla, taking half the kingdom for himself and leaving the other half to Drupada.\nMeanwhile, news reaches Hastināpura of Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, Kuntī’s nephews, who have slain the tyrant Kaṃsa of Mathurā and now lead the Yadus. Balarāma comes to Hastināpura to teach mace fighting to Bhīma and Duryodhana, while Kṛṣṇa, concerned for Kuntī and her sons, sends his kinsman Akrūra to assess the situation. Akrūra comforts Kuntī but also warns Dhṛtarāṣṭra to treat the Pāṇḍavas fairly. The king admits his weakness: though he knows Yudhiṣṭhira is the rightful heir, he cannot overcome his blind affection for his sons.\nAt Bhīṣma and Vidura’s urging, Yudhiṣṭhira is made prince regent, delighting the people but enraging Duryodhana. With Śakuni’s guidance, the Kauravas begin plotting to eliminate the Pāṇḍavas through deceit, considering luring them to Vāraṇāvata where a deadly trap can be sprung.",

With Śakuni’s counsel, he hatches the Lac House scheme at Vāraṇāvata and orders his minister Purocana to construct a palace of lac, ghee, and oil that can be burned in an instant. Vidura, loyal to the Pāṇḍavas, warns Yudhiṣṭhira in coded speech and arranges a miner to build an escape tunnel.\nThe Pāṇḍavas depart Hastināpura with their mother Kuntī, taking leave of their elders. Despite the grief of the citizens, they settle in Vāraṇāvata and appear unsuspecting. At night they quietly complete the tunnel.\nWhen the house is set aflame, it is not by accident or Purocana’s hand, but by the Pāṇḍavas themselves: on Yudhiṣṭhira’s instruction, Bhīma torches the walls and doorways so that Duryodhana will believe his plan has succeeded. In the inferno, Purocana perishes, and the remains of a Niṣāda woman and her five sons—unwitting guests trapped inside—further convince the kingdom that the Pāṇḍavas have died in the blaze. Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Bhīṣma, Droṇa, and Kṛpa perform funeral rites, while only Vidura knows the truth.\nEscaping through the tunnel, the Pāṇḍavas are ferried across the Gaṅgā by Vidura’s emissary and journey into a dense forest. Exhausted, they are carried on Bhīma’s mighty frame until nightfall. There they encounter the rākṣasa Hiḍimba, who seeks to devour them, and his sister Hiḍimbī, who falls in love with Bhīma. A fierce combat follows, and Bhīma slays Hiḍimba in single combat, protecting his family and establishing himself as their fearless guardian.",

Bhīma and Hiḍimbī live together for seven months, and she gives birth to a powerful son, Ghaṭotkaca, who grows to adulthood within days. Though a rākṣasa by nature, he is virtuous and devoted to the Pāṇḍavas, promising to aid them whenever called. When it is time to part, Bhīma leaves Hiḍimbī, and the brothers continue their wandering exile disguised as ascetics.\nVyāsa appears and leads them to the village of Ekacakra, where they take shelter in a brahmin’s house. There, Kuntī overhears the family’s grief: each week a villager must deliver food — and their own life — to the man-eating rākṣasa Baka. The brahmin’s turn has come. Out of gratitude for their host’s kindness, Kuntī volunteers her son Bhīma to fulfill the deadly duty. Despite Yudhiṣṭhira’s initial concern, she insists that Bhīma’s strength is more than sufficient. At night, Bhīma drives the cart of food into the forest, devours the provisions himself, and then battles Baka. The two clash violently, hurling trees and grappling like elephants. In the end Bhīma crushes Baka and breaks his back, killing him. Terrified, the other rākṣasas swear to stop preying on humans.

    "summary": "At dawn, the people of Ekacakra discovered the corpse of the rākṣasa Baka, slain by Bhīma the previous night. Believing a traveling brāhmaṇa had accomplished the impossible feat, they rejoiced and declared a festival. The Pāṇḍavas remained quietly in their host’s house, continuing their life of disguise, alms, and study.\nA wandering ascetic visited and told the story of King Drupada’s fire sacrifice, performed with the help of sages Yaja and Upayaja, which produced two children: Dhṛṣṭadyumna, destined to slay Droṇa, and Draupadī, the most radiant of women, born for a fated marriage. Hearing this, Kuntī perceived her sons’ interest and suggested they journey to attend her svayaṃvara.\nOn their travels, Vyāsa appeared, instructing them to seek Draupadī’s hand, particularly urging Arjuna to compete. Later that night, by the Gaṅgā, they encountered the proud Gandharva Aṅgaraparna (Citraratha), who barred their passage. Arjuna defeated him with the Agneyāstra, but Yudhiṣṭhira spared his life at his wife Kumbhīnāśī’s plea. In gratitude, the humbled Gandharva offered knowledge and celestial horses, warning the princes of the importance of purity, celibacy, and a priestly guide. He also narrated their lineage from Tapati. Following his advice, they sought the sage Dhaumya at Utkacaka, who accepted them as disciples and became their priest. With his blessings, the brothers set out toward Pañcāla to attend Draupadī’s svayaṃvara.",

    "summary": "Guided by Dhaumya, the Pāṇḍavas traveled toward Pañcāla, mingling with brāhmaṇas heading to Draupadī’s svayaṃvara. Disguised as humble ascetics, they took shelter in a potter’s house and lived on alms while awaiting the great event.\nKing Drupada prepared an opulent stadium with jeweled gates, terraces, and mansions for the visiting monarchs. The svayaṃvara began with celebrations, sacrifices, and lavish charity for the brāhmaṇas. On the sixteenth day, Draupadī entered, carrying the nuptial garland, dazzling all with her celestial beauty. Even the gods, sages, and gandharvas gathered in the skies to witness the contest.\nDrupada’s challenge was announced: whoever could string a mighty bow and shoot an arrow through a revolving disc to strike a target would win Draupadī’s hand. One by one, kings and princes failed—cast down by the bow’s weight and unyielding string. Karṇa stepped forward, but Draupadī refused to let a sūta’s son compete, humiliating him. Other kings, including Śiśupāla, Jarāsandha, and Duryodhana, also failed.\nAt last, Arjuna, disguised as a brāhmaṇa, stepped forth with Dhaumya’s blessing. Though some elders protested, others extolled the spiritual power of brahmins. Arjuna easily strung the bow, invoked Kṛṣṇa in prayer, and pierced the target flawlessly. The arena erupted with divine praise, showers of flowers, and the cheers of brāhmaṇas. Draupadī joyfully garlanded him, believing destiny fulfilled.\nFury seized the defeated kings, who accused Drupada of insulting them. Weapons were raised, and Drupada feared for his life. At Yudhiṣṭhira’s signal, Bhīma and Arjuna defended him—Bhīma uprooting a tree, Arjuna armed with the bow. Karṇa challenged Arjuna but, astonished by his prowess, broke off the duel. Bhīma fought Śalya, throwing him aside but sparing him as Mādrī’s brother. The monarchs hesitated, suspecting the “brāhmaṇas” were in truth mighty kṣatriyas.\nKṛṣṇa then intervened, urging peace, and the kings dispersed in awe. Draupadī’s hand had been won fairly, and Arjuna led her away, guarded by his brothers.",

    "summary": "Bhīma and Arjuna, bloodied from defending Drupada, slip out of the arena with brāhmaṇas’ cheers and rejoin their brothers and Draupadī at the potter’s house. At home, Kuntī—anxious in their absence—tells Arjuna to “share among yourselves whatever you have acquired,” then realizes he has “brought” Draupadī. To keep her vow of truth without sin, Yudhiṣṭhira judges that Draupadī should become the common wife of all five brothers, averting rivalry and fulfilling destiny.\nKṛṣṇa and Balarāma quietly visit, acknowledge the Pāṇḍavas’ feats, bless them, and depart to avoid exposing their disguise. Dṛṣṭadyumna secretly observes the household (Kuntī instructing Draupadī; the brothers’ warrior talk) and reports to Drupada, who sends his priest to confirm their identities. Yudhiṣṭhira reveals they are Pāṇḍu’s sons.\nWhen Drupada hesitates at the unprecedented marriage, a council is held. Yudhiṣṭhira cites precedents (Jatilā; the Pracetas brothers). Vyāsa arrives, assures Kuntī she is free from sin, reveals Draupadī’s prior-life boon from Śiva (asked five times for a husband) and her nature as an expansion of Lakṣmī; he also discloses the brothers’ ancient connections to Indra. Convinced, Drupada consents.\nUnder Dhaumya’s rites, weddings are performed during the auspicious Puṣyā constellation: first Yudhiṣṭhira with Draupadī, then each brother in turn on successive days. Drupada grants vast gifts. From Mathurā, Kṛṣṇa sends further treasure and retinues. Settled in Kāmpilya, the Pāṇḍavas rejoice in their new alliance with Pañcāla.",
